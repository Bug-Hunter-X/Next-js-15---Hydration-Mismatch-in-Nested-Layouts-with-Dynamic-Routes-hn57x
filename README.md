# Next.js 15 Hydration Mismatch in Nested Layouts with Dynamic Routes

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Next.js 15's `app` directory when using nested layouts and dynamic data fetching.  The problem arises when a layout attempts to access data that is only available in certain routes, leading to hydration mismatches or runtime errors.

## Problem

A nested layout tries to fetch data that might not be available for all routes under its scope. This causes errors when rendering different pages.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that data fetching is done within the page component itself or using a conditional check to see if the data exists before attempting to use it within the layout.  This prevents hydration mismatches and improves robustness.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
