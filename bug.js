In Next.js 15, using the `app` directory with dynamic routes and nested layouts can lead to unexpected behavior if not handled correctly. For example, a common issue is when a nested layout tries to access data that's only available within a specific page route.  This can manifest as hydration mismatches or runtime errors.

Example:

```javascript
// app/layout.js
import { getData } from './utils';

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  const data = getData(); // This might fail in some routes
  return (
    <html>
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

```javascript
// app/page.js
//This page is fine
```

```javascript
// app/about/page.js
//This page will cause error because getData() might return an error in this route
```
